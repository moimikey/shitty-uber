# surge
Is there surge pricing around me right now? This little CLI utility will determine your location (currently OS X only) using location services and determine if surge pricing is active within your range.

## installation
```
$ npm -g install surge
$ surge
uberX       ✔ GOOD
uberXL      ✔ GOOD
UberBLACK   $ SURGE 2.8x
UberSUV     $ SURGE 2.8x
uberT       ✔ GOOD
```
